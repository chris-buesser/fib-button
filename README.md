# Fib Button

## Tasks

1. Make FibButton increment the current value of the [Fibonacci
   sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence), always starting
   from 1 on a page refresh
2. Write the test in `src/component/FibButton.test.tsx` to check it through
   the 20th Fibonacci number
3. Implement or use a feature to run the tests automatically on git commit and
   fix or fail the commit before successfully completing the commit
